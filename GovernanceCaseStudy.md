# Case Study — Multi-Stakeholder Governance

**Issue:** [#26](https://github.com/jimscarver/quantum-os/issues/26) · **Macro:** `gov-9stage` ([`RhoQuCalc_Macros.md`](RhoQuCalc_Macros.md)) · **Built on:** [`Governance.md`](Governance.md) (liquid democracy), [`Group_Decisions.md`](Group_Decisions.md)

A decentralized, multi-stakeholder governance process run entirely in the browser mesh — propose system
changes, delegate voting rights, and reach robust consensus with no central server.

## The scenario

Stakeholder groups, mapped to **object-capability tokens** (no central registry):

- **Users** — run dApps, contribute operational sentiment.
- **Developers** — propose kernel modifications, submit patches (`Developer` cap-token gated).
- **Validators** — run verification nodes.
- **Token holders** — economic stake, liquid voting weight.

Every architectural change or budget decision walks a **9-stage decision loop**:
`Identify → Define goal → Source solutions → Evaluate & size → Select → Deploy → Monitor → Adjust → Lesson`.

## Grounded in the real commands

The original (gemini) draft invented a `/sys/gov` panel, sentiment sliders, and a "memory-demon" loop.
[quantum-os](README.md) already has the substance — the case study maps onto it:

| Stage | Real quantum-os mechanism |
|---|---|
| 1–2 Identify / Goal | `/lemma issue@identify`, `/lemma issue@goal` — assert the problem/goal of record |
| 3 Source solutions | `/channel` — open deliberation; `Developer`-cap peers point to a git branch |
| 4 Evaluate & size | **`/estimate --median`** — each peer enters a numeric impact; the **median** is whale/outlier-resistant *(built, mesh-synced)* |
| 5 Select | **`/gov vote`** — liquid-democracy weighted tally; non-voters' weight flows to their delegate, transitively ([`Governance.md`](Governance.md)) |
| 6 Deploy | `/lemma issue@deploy` — assert the chosen artifact |
| 7 Monitor | `/probe issue@monitor` — chain-weighted consensus snapshot on live metrics |
| 8 Adjust | `dagger` (`/gov undelegate` / amend) — the revocable dual |
| 9 Lesson | `/lemma issue@lesson` + `/persist` — the durable closure receipt |

**Liquid democracy is already built** (`/gov delegate <peer> [on <issue>]`, standing/transitive/revocable;
direct vote always overrides). The **sentiment-slider / pros-cons** UI is optional surface over `/estimate`
+ `/channel`.

## The macro

```
gov-9stage(issue) :=
  sequence (action /lemma issue@identify)      (action /lemma issue@goal)
  ▸ sequence (action /channel issue)           (lift   /estimate issue --median)   ◄ /estimate ✅
  ▸ sequence (lift   /gov vote issue)          (action /lemma issue@deploy)
  ▸ sequence (lift   /probe issue@monitor)     (dagger (/lemma issue@deploy))
  ▸          (action /lemma issue@lesson) /persist
```

As a verified ρ-process the macro inherits ZFA well-formedness, reflection (name = quote), and capability
security (name = O-cap) — see [`RhoQuCalc_Macros.md`](RhoQuCalc_Macros.md) for the `/command`↔constructor
mapping.

## Runs today vs. open

- ✅ **Runs today:** `/gov` (liquid delegation + weighted tally), `/poll`/`/probe`, `/lemma`+`/persist`,
  `/channel`, capability-token stakeholder roles, and the **`/estimate` median** round (mesh-synced).
- 🔵 **Open:** the **`RhoProcess` macro IR + mesh-shared macro names** so a community adopts `gov-9stage`
  once and every peer has it; the sentiment-slider UI.
