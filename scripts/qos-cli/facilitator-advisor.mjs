// gets authority. The facilitator is fully functional without it — `makeAdvisor`
// returns a disabled advisor when `--ai` is off or no API key is present, and the
// deterministic v1 behaviours carry the room.
//
// Two backends (pick with `--ai-backend`):
//   • api (default)         — Anthropic Messages API via global `fetch` (Node 18+), key from
//                             ANTHROPIC_API_KEY. Pay-as-you-go API credits.
//   • claude-code           — shells out to the local `claude` CLI in print mode, using the
//                             user's Claude login (Pro/Max subscription) — NO API credits.
// Calls are made only when the throttle would allow a post (the daemon gates them), so usage is
// bounded by the same budget/cooldowns.

converge. Given the problem and the recent discussion, reply with three short parts, plainly and with

2. CANDIDATES — propose 2 to 4 concrete candidate solutions, ONE LINE EACH; OR, if candidates are
   already on the table in the discussion, refine/combine the leading ones (explore wide early,
