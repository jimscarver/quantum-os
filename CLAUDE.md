# CLAUDE.md — QuantumOS

Project context for Claude Code sessions. Read this before making any changes.

## Project overview

**QuantumOS** is a peer-to-peer browser application that makes ZFA (Zero Free Action) capability tokens the live security model of a collaborative computing room. Two or more browser peers connect via WebRTC, share a room identified by a ZFA capability token, and run QLF slash commands (`/qucalc`, `/lemma`, `/braket`, `/zfa`, …) whose results broadcast to all peers.

The ZFA kernel is implemented in Rust (compiled to WASM) and is the same algebraic core as the [Quantum Logical Framework](https://github.com/jimscarver/quantum-logical-framework). Possessing a capability token IS authorization — no server, no accounts, no trust.

**Live deployment:** https://jimscarver.github.io/quantum-os/
**Signaling server:** `wss://quantum-os-signaling.onrender.com` (Render.com, auto-deploys from `packages/signaling/`)

## Key concepts

### ZFA capability tokens

Every peer identity, room ID, and named lemma cap is a `cap:label:hex` token:

```
cap:peer:024602460246024602460246…
     ↑       ↑
  label    hex digits 0–7 only (each is a twist value)
           ZFA: count balance ∧ Pauli closure (see below)
```

- Generated with `crypto.getRandomValues()` (browser) or `getrandom` crate (Rust); since v0.17, `from_entropy` uses rejection sampling to guarantee Pauli closure (~4 iterations expected per token).
- 128-bit entropy; ZFA constraint still leaves astronomically large space.
- `validateCapability(token)` — checks format, count balance, AND Pauli closure.
- `tokenTwists(token)` — extracts `Uint8Array` of twist values from hex.
- Knowing a room token IS the capability to join (bearer token in URL hash).

### Twist alphabet (8 symbols)

| Symbol | Value | Parity | Name |
|--------|-------|--------|------|
| `^` | 0 | even/pos | Up |
| `v` | 1 | odd/neg | Down |
| `<` | 2 | even/pos | Left |
| `>` | 3 | odd/neg | Right |
| `/` | 4 | even/pos | Slash |
| `\` | 5 | odd/neg | Backslash |
| `+` | 6 | even/pos | Plus |
| `-` | 7 | odd/neg | Minus |

**ZFA = count balance ∧ Pauli closure** (v0.17+). Two conditions are enforced:

1. **Count balance**: `count_pos == count_neg` (even count == odd count). Spectral gap = `|count_pos − count_neg|` = 0.
2. **Pauli closure**: the matrix product of twists folds to a scalar multiple of the identity — a member of `{+I, −I, +iI, −iI}`. Each twist maps to a Pauli matrix (`^v` ↔ ±σ_y, `<>` ↔ ∓σ_x, `/\` ↔ ±σ_z, `+-` ↔ ±I). Order matters because Pauli matrices anti-commute.

Both halves are enforced uniformly in `crates/zfa-core/src/pauli.rs`, `packages/browser/src/zfa.ts`, and the QLF Python core `twist_core.py`.

### Lemma system

Named logical claims shared across peers, persisted to `localStorage` per room URL.

- `/lemma name` — auto-allocate twists deterministically from the name (same result on every client, no server needed)
- `/lemma name twists` — explicit twists (symbolic, hex, `cap:token`, or `@ref1 @ref2`)
- `@name` in any command arg — expands to the stored twist sequence
- Auto-mints `cap:name:hex` when the result is ZFA-balanced
- Broadcasts `{kind: "lemma", name, twists, cap, who}` to all peers on register
- `allocateTwists(name)`: each character yields one pos twist `(code & 3)*2` and one neg twist `((code>>2)&3)*2+1` — always balanced, always deterministic

**Transfer commands** (peer-to-peer, not broadcast):
- `/request name` — broadcasts `{kind: "lemma-request", name, fromName}`; holder's window shows a prompt with the ready-to-type `/pass` command
- `/pass name peer-name` — looks up `peerNames` to find peerId, sends `{kind: "lemma-pass", name, twists, cap}` directly via data channel, deletes from sender's `lemmaStore`; recipient auto-registers and sees confirmation
- `findPeerByName(name)`: exact then prefix match on `peerNames` map (case-insensitive)

### Promissory notes (`/note` — `notes.ts` + `app.ts`)

Bearer instruments as ZFA capabilities. Format `cap:note-<currency>:<balanced hex>`; **denomination = `hex.length / 2`**. Conservation falls out of the existing balance invariant — split/merge preserve `count_pos == count_neg`.

Three label kinds parsed by `parseNoteLabel`: `token` (issuer authority), `note` (bearer denomination), `receipt` (permanent redemption record). Lifecycle vocabulary borrowed from DarkWow's TokenMint → Mint → Transfer → Redeem, but implemented with no ZK, no Pedersen, no consensus.

Stores (per-room `localStorage`):
- `currencyTokens: Map<currency, token>` — currencies *I issue* (private bearer authority)
- `knownCurrencies: Map<token, KnownCurrency>` — *public* registry of every declared currency in the room (populated from `note-declare` broadcasts and `sync-currencies` snapshots)
- `noteStore: Map<token, NoteEntry>` — bearer notes I currently hold
- `receiptStore: Map<token, ReceiptEntry>` — redemption receipts (permanent, non-transferable)
- `redemptionsHonored: Map<token, RedemptionRecord>` — issuer-side accounting

Wire kinds: `note-declare` (broadcast), `note-grant` (broadcast — currency + denomination only, the bearer token stays private), `note-pass` / `note-redeem` / `note-receipt` (direct).

The sidebar's **Currencies** block shows `currencyTokens` entries with `✦` and others' declarations with the issuer's name; **Notes** shows `noteStore`. Click handlers prefill the input. Receipts and redemptions are chat-only.

### Rendezvous (`/rdv` — `rendezvous.ts` + `app.ts`)

N-party atomic synchronization. Each participant contributes a `gives` token and receives a `gets` token; `conservationCheck(rows)` enforces `multiset(gives) == multiset(gets)` over the joint composition.

Protocol (5 direct-send wire kinds, never broadcast): `rdv-propose`, `rdv-accept`, `rdv-reject`, `rdv-commit`, `rdv-abort`. The proposer collects accepts (each accept carries the participant's committed gives token), and on all-accepts builds commit rows via the cyclic mapping `row[i].gets = next-row.gives` and dispatches `rdv-commit`. Each participant applies locally: `lockedNotes.delete(givesToken); noteStore.set(getsToken, …)`.

Locking: accepted-but-not-yet-committed tokens move from `noteStore` to `lockedNotes` (so `/note pass` etc. don't see them). Released on abort/reject/timeout. On reload, locks are orphaned (proposal state is in-memory only) and auto-released back to `noteStore` in `loadNotes()` — so value is never lost across a crash.

Atomicity is best-effort, same trust model as `/note pass`. 60s default timeout via `scheduleProposalTimeout` / `proposalTimedOut`.

### Dynamic capabilities (`/dyncap` — `dyncap.ts` + `app.ts`)

Hash-only identity layer. Uses `crypto.subtle.digest("SHA-256", …)` — browser built-in, no external library, no keypairs, no signatures.

State per peer (private, in `localStorage` under `qos-dyncap-state`, cross-room):
- `seed: Uint8Array(32)` — generated at first launch, never broadcast
- `anchor: string` — hex of `H(seed)`, 64 chars; the peer's permanent identity
- `seq: number` — monotonically incremented per signed envelope

Signed envelope grows: `dyncap: { anchor, seq, witness }` where `witness = H(seed || seq_le32 || room_id_bytes || payload_hash)`. `payload_hash` covers a canonical serialization (sorted keys, JSON, dyncap stripped) of the envelope.

Receivers maintain `dyncapChains: Map<peerId, ChainEntry>` per room. TOFU-pin the first observed anchor. Subsequent envelopes must extend the chain — monotonic `seq`, unseen `witness`. Two valid envelopes at the same `seq` under the same anchor are a *fork*; the entry is flagged `contested` and the user is warned via `⚠` chat line.

Outbound wired in: `signedBroadcast` and `signedSend` are drop-in wrappers replacing direct `qpeer.broadcast` / `qpeer.send` for envelope kinds we sign. A `signQueue: Promise` chain serializes outbound signings so `seq` ordering is preserved across concurrent broadcasts.

Currently signed: `name`, `lemma`, `note-declare`, `sync-lemmas`, `sync-currencies`. `LemmaEntry` and `KnownCurrency` gained an optional `dyncap?: DyncapField` field so sync-forwarded entries carry the original author's chain step. Inner-entry verification against the original author's anchor (cross-peer lookup) is a future revision.

Trust ceiling: TOFU at first contact + chain-tamper / replay / fork detection. Cannot mathematically verify the seed (hash-only). Race condition if a clone broadcasts before the real holder. Cross-room continuity not provided. See SECURITY.md for full threat enumeration.

### Multi-room with per-room Markov blankets (`/room` — `app.ts`)

A single browser session can join N rooms simultaneously, each as a tab across the top of the UI. The full reference framing is below; concrete summary for code work:

State model:
- `RoomContext` interface (defined in `app.ts`) collects all per-room state: `lemmaStore`, `noteStore`, `currencyTokens`, `knownCurrencies`, `receiptStore`, `redemptionsHonored`, `lockedNotes`, `proposals`, `proposalTimers`, `dyncapChains`, `probe`, `ignoredForSync`, `chatLog`, `peers`, `peerNames`, `pendingLeaves`, `qpeer`, `signalingUrl`, `hasUnread`, `roomId`.
- `const rooms: Map<roomId, RoomContext>` — all joined rooms.
- `let activeRoom: RoomContext` — the room whose state is aliased into the module-level `let` bindings (`lemmaStore`, `peers`, …). Temporarily swapped by inbound QOSPeer callbacks via `setActiveRoom(ctx)` so background activity lands in the right room.
- `let uiActiveRoom: RoomContext` — the room the user is *looking at*. Changes only on `switchToRoom`. DOM-touching helpers (`addMessage`, `renderPeers`, `renderLemmas`, `renderNotes`, `renderRoomProcess`, `setStatus`) guard with `isUiActive()` (= `activeRoom === uiActiveRoom`) so a background callback doesn't disturb the visible tab.

Cross-room state (not in `RoomContext`):
- `myName`, `dyncapState` (with `seqByRoom: Record<roomId, number>`), `signQueue`, `sessionLog`. Per-device, shared across all rooms.

Tab UI:
- HTML: `#tab-bar` with `#tab-list` and `#tab-add` (the `+` button). CSS classes `.tab`, `.tab.active`, `.tab.unread`.
- `renderTabs()` paints from `rooms.values()`; the unread indicator is an orange `●` prefix on tabs where `ctx.hasUnread && ctx !== uiActiveRoom`. Tab clicks call `switchToRoom`.
- `switchToRoom(roomId)` calls `setActiveRoom(next)`, sets `uiActiveRoom = next`, clears `next.hasUnread`, and calls `applyActiveRoomToUI()` which re-renders everything from the new active room (replays `chatLog`, updates sidebar, syncs URL hash via `history.replaceState`).

Persistence: `qos-joined-rooms` localStorage key holds the array of joined room IDs. On reload, every room is restored via `loadRoomState(ctx)` (which briefly swaps `activeRoom` to `ctx` while `loadLemmas` / `loadNotes` run). The URL-hash room becomes the initial active room.

Callback model for simultaneous connections:
- Each `connect()` call captures `const ctx = activeRoom` at QOSPeer construction time. Every callback wraps its body in `const prev = activeRoom; setActiveRoom(ctx); try { … } finally { setActiveRoom(prev); }`.
- For `async onMessage`, the same wrapper applies plus a manual `setActiveRoom(ctx)` after each `await verifyDyncapIfPresent(…)` — the binding doesn't survive await suspensions, so we re-assert at each resumption point.
- DOM-touching code (the renderer guards above + direct `msgInput.disabled` / `connectBtn.textContent` writes) checks `isUiActive()` so background-callback DOM noise is suppressed.

The bridge-peer model: there's no protocol-level "cross-room" envelope. A peer in two rooms manually re-declares lemmas / re-grants notes in each room via the dispatcher (which acts on `activeRoom`, i.e. the current tab). Future work: an explicit `/share` command that copies a selected item from the active room into a named tab. Today, manual re-declaration is the bridge primitive.

### Discrepancy probe — joiner-local supermajority (`/probe` — `probe.ts` + `app.ts`)

Partial-consensus layer that runs when a peer joins a room. The full reference doc is [Consensus.md](Consensus.md); the implementation summary for code work:

State (per room, joiner only):
- `probe: ProbeWindow` — `{ open, observations: Observation[], contributors: Set<peerId>, timer }`. Opened in `onSignalingOpen`, closes on `PROBE_WINDOW_MS` (5000) timeout or after `SAMPLE_SIZE` (5) distinct senders.
- `ignoredForSync: Set<peerId>` — peers whose sync envelopes are silently dropped (persisted under `qos-ignored-sync-{room}`).

Constants in `probe.ts`: `SAMPLE_SIZE`, `PROBE_WINDOW_MS`, `SUPERMAJORITY_NUM = 2`, `SUPERMAJORITY_DEN = 3`.

Observation shape: `{ storeName: "lemmas"|"currencies", key, value (JSON-normalized), peer, weight }`. Weight is `dyncapChains.get(peer)?.lastSeq ?? 1` (floor 1), captured by `recordSyncObservations` when each `sync-lemmas` / `sync-currencies` arrives during the window.

`findDiscrepancies` groups by `(storeName, key)`; for each group it buckets by value, sums weights, sorts buckets by weight desc (count desc, first-seen as tiebreak). The leading bucket's value becomes the `winner` only if `leader.weight × DEN > totalWeight × NUM` (strict supermajority). Otherwise `winner: null` (contested, unresolved). `losingPeersIn` returns peers in non-winner buckets only for *resolved* discrepancies — contested discrepancies produce no losers.

On close, `closeProbeWindow`:
- For each resolved discrepancy: apply the winner to `lemmaStore` / `knownCurrencies` locally, broadcast `state-discrepancy { ..., winner: <object> }`, add losers to `ignoredForSync`.
- For each contested discrepancy: broadcast `state-discrepancy { ..., winner: null }`, no local change, no losers added.

The `state-discrepancy` inbound handler logs the broadcast on receipt; non-joining peers do *not* auto-update on receipt (joiner-local resolution).

**Critical preflight: lemma immutability.** Once `@name` is in `lemmaStore`, both the `case "lemma"` dispatcher and the inbound `lemma` handler refuse a re-declaration with different `twists` (idempotent re-declare is silently a no-op). Without this, the probe's notion of "discrepancy" would be meaningless — peers could just overwrite each other's lemma state. The fix is in `app.ts` around the existing dispatcher block and the inbound handler.

### Room state sync on data channel open

When a new data channel opens (`onChannelOpen(peerId)` in `connect()`), the peer sends the new arrival:
- `name` (existing) — display name
- `sync-lemmas` — `Array<{name, twists, who, cap?}>` from `lemmaStore`
- `sync-currencies` — `Array<KnownCurrency>` from `knownCurrencies`

Inbound handlers validate every entry with the same label/ZFA-balance checks as the live `lemma` / `note-declare` flows. First-write-wins dedupe by lemma name; currency dedupe by token. Held notes / receipts / redemptions are *never* gossiped — they're private bearer state.

### Signaling server trust model

The signaling server is an **untrusted relay**:
- Routes SDP/ICE between peers; never sees WebRTC data channel contents (DTLS-encrypted)
- `wsIndex: Map<WebSocket, string>` — binds each socket to its peerId at join; validates `msg.from` on every relay to prevent forgery
- Rate-limited: 20 msg/sec per connection (fixed window)
- Message size capped at 64 KB (`maxPayload: 65_536`)
- Logs show only last 8 chars of IDs

### Signaling reconnect / false peer left-right

When the signaling WebSocket drops and reconnects (Render.com sleep, network blip):

- **`peer.ts`**: On receiving the `"peers"` list after reconnect, skip peers where the WebRTC data channel is still open — avoids tearing down a working connection
- **`app.ts`**: `onPeerLeft` is debounced 6 seconds via `pendingLeaves: Map<string, timer>`. If the peer rejoins within the window, suppress both "left" and "joined" messages silently

Excluded commands send purpose-specific envelopes (or are local-only) so a generic qlf rebroadcast would be redundant or noisy. `/rhoqu` itself doesn't broadcast — only the commands it transpiles to do, per their own rules.

## Philosophical foundations (shared with QLF)

QuantumOS is the **executable instantiation** of the Quantum Logical Framework. The ZFA capability model is not an analogy — it is the same algebraic invariant that QLF machine-verifies in Lean 4:

- `rho_process_always_zfa` — parallel composition stays ZFA-balanced
- `decoherence_impossibility` — no operation can break ZFA balance
- `bra_ket_always_balanced` — bra-ket well-typedness IS ZFA balance

In a classical OS, security, scheduling, error correction, and garbage collection are separate subsystems. In QuantumOS all five are the same operation — ZFA enforcement — because possessing a capability token IS proof of authorization (Curry-Howard). The room process `parallel(peer1, peer2, …)` is machine-verified to stay balanced under composition.

The QLF math substrate has **active inference built into its foundation**: every admissible state is a free-energy-minimizing trajectory of a Markov-blanket agent, with per-event ΔF = −log 2 saturation by half-spin ZFA closure. The kernel here realises that substrate as an executable system — every capability token, every room, every closure is a concrete instance of the active-inference math. The meta-doc claims QLF as a candidate TOE and ZFC-replacement for the part of mathematics with a physical / agent-constructible referent — explicitly excluding what Gödel and the Busy Beaver result establish as ZFC's undecidable interior. The per-event ΔF = −log 2 quantum is now Lean-anchored as `zfa_closure_minimizes_free_energy` in QLF's `lean/QLF_FreeEnergy.lean`, with brute-force numerical verification in `active_inference_vfe_demo.py`. The runtime ZFA check this kernel uses (`is_zfa = is_count_balanced ∧ is_pauli_closed` in `crates/zfa-core` and `packages/browser/src/zfa.ts`) now has Lean anchors at **three layers**: count balance under concatenation (`emergent_blanket_formation` in `lean/QLF_QuCalc.lean`), Pauli closure under concatenation in the abstract scalar group (`pauli_closed_of_admissible_zfa` in `lean/QLF_Pauli.lean`), and the explicit σ-matrix mapping for Hermitian-pair atoms plus their N-pair concatenations (`hermitian_pair_is_pauli_scalar` and `concat_pairs_is_pauli_scalar` in `lean/QLF_TwistAlphabet.lean`). The same twist algebra compiles to runnable Eu:YSO pulse sequences via QLF's `compile_qpu.py` (Crystal-QPU pulse compiler sketch). Relativistic kinematics on the same substrate is sketched in QLF's [Cross_Frequency_Lorentz.md](https://github.com/jimscarver/quantum-logical-framework/blob/main/Cross_Frequency_Lorentz.md), which identifies γ = cosh(rapidity) with a Markov-blanket internal-frequency ratio. A first quantitative Standard-Model probe lives in `lepton_mass_demo.py` — the naive "mass ∝ multiplicity at depth" hypothesis is falsified for leptons (useful negative result that constrains the eventual derivation). The browser app's slash-command + capability-token primitives are sketched as the control plane for a future quiet-frequency crystal QPU in QLF's [Crystal_QuantumOS.md](https://github.com/jimscarver/quantum-logical-framework/blob/main/Crystal_QuantumOS.md); the qubit-register-scale Markov-blanket layer is sketched in [Emergent_Markov_Blankets.md](https://github.com/jimscarver/quantum-logical-framework/blob/main/Emergent_Markov_Blankets.md). See [Active_Inference_Mathematics.md](https://github.com/jimscarver/quantum-logical-framework/blob/main/Active_Inference_Mathematics.md) for the foundations meta-doc.

See [QLF CLAUDE.md](../quantum-logical-framework/CLAUDE.md) and [AI.md](https://github.com/jimscarver/quantum-logical-framework/blob/main/AI.md) for the full theoretical background.

### What NOT to say

- Do not describe the signaling server as trusted — it is an explicit untrusted relay
- Do not describe ZFA tokens as "passwords" or "API keys" — possessing the token IS the capability, with no separate authentication step
- Do not describe lemma auto-allocation as random — it is deterministic from the name, giving identical results on every client
- Do not describe the room as a server — the room is the emergent ZFA process of the peers; the signaling server only routes handshakes
