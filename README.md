# quantum-os

**Create reality together.** Two peers in a room share a ZFA process space — a combined `parallel(peer1, peer2, …)` that is provably ZFA-balanced by construction. The room is not a chat channel; it is a shared physical process where every identity is a capability token and every interaction is a verified quantum logical event.

Peer-to-peer QuantumOS running in the browser. ZFA kernel in Rust/WASM, WebRTC data channels for transport, self-hosted signaling server.

### How to create reality together

1. Open **https://jimscarver.github.io/quantum-os/** in your browser.
2. Click **Connect** — you join a room identified by a ZFA capability token in the URL hash. Your peer ID is a ZFA-balanced process.
3. Copy the share link and send it to someone (or open a second tab).
4. The second peer clicks **Connect** — both appear in the **Peers** list.
5. The **Room Process** panel shows the combined `parallel(you, peer)` process — ZFA-balanced across all peers.
6. Run QLF slash commands (`/braket +`, `/qucalc ^v`) — output broadcasts to every peer in the room.
7. Click a peer's name to instantly evaluate their ZFA process with `/qucalc`.
8. Use `/lemma name` to name a logical claim — twists are auto-allocated from the name, or supply them explicitly (`/lemma mortality ^v`). Reference with `@name` in any command (`/qucalc @mortality @socrates` deduces from both). Lemmas sync to all peers and persist across page reloads.
9. Use `/grant [label]` to mint a random ZFA capability token and share it as a proof object.
10. Use `/request name` to signal you need a named lemma; the holder sees a prompt and can `/pass name peer` to transfer it directly — no token strings to copy.

The room URL encodes a ZFA capability token in the hash (`#room=cap:room:…`). Anyone with the link can join — no account needed. The public signaling server (`wss://quantum-os-signaling.onrender.com`) is used by default; edit the field to point at a self-hosted server.

**Foundation:** [Quantum Logical Framework](https://github.com/jimscarver/quantum-logical-framework) — ZFA (Zero Free Action) is the security model. Every peer identity is a ZFA-balanced capability token. Possessing a token IS authorization (Curry-Howard for capabilities). The room process `parallel(peer1, peer2, …)` is machine-verified to stay ZFA-balanced under composition — decoherence is impossible by construction.

```

### `/braket <state>` [shared]
Evaluates a bra-ket expression using the `Form` 2×2 Hermitian matrix algebra from `SpacetimeDynamics.lean`. States: `0`, `1`, `+`, `-`, `i`, `-i`. Multiple states (space-separated) compose as `parallel` (matrix addition = superposition). Output broadcasts to all peers.

`Form.toMatrix = [[t+z, x−iy],[x+iy, t−z]]`

Input:
```
/braket +
```
Output:
```
· ket: |+⟩
·   RhoProcess: action(Form_+)
·   eval = Form.toMatrix:
·   ⎡ 0.5  0.5 ⎤
·   ⎣ 0.5  0.5 ⎦
· bra: ⟨+|  (eval = ket†  =  ket  [Hermitian: Form.toMatrix_adjoint ✓])
·   ZFA: action [+,−]  lift [−,+]  both balanced: ✓
·   bra_ket_always_balanced: ✓ (BraKetRhoQuCalc.lean)
```

Input:
```
/braket 0 1
```
Output:
```
· ket: |0⟩ + |1⟩
·   RhoProcess: parallel(action(Form_0), action(Form_1))
·   eval = Form.toMatrix:
·   ⎡ 1  0 ⎤
·   ⎣ 0  1 ⎦
· bra: ⟨0| + ⟨1|  (eval = ket†  =  ket  [Hermitian: Form.toMatrix_adjoint ✓])
·   ZFA: action [+,−]  lift [−,+]  both balanced: ✓
·   bra_ket_always_balanced: ✓ (BraKetRhoQuCalc.lean)
```

The `|0⟩ + |1⟩` superposition yields the identity matrix — a complete basis. See [BraKetRhoQuCalc.md](https://github.com/jimscarver/quantum-logical-framework/blob/main/BraKetRhoQuCalc.md) for the full bra-ket ↔ RhoQuCalc correspondence.

Lean anchor: [`bra_ket_always_balanced`](https://github.com/jimscarver/quantum-logical-framework/blob/main/lean/BraKetRhoQuCalc.lean)

### `/qucalc [twists]` [shared]
Evaluates a RhoQuCalc twist sequence. Accepts symbolic twists (`^v<>/\+-`), hex digits `0-7`, a `cap:label:hex` token, or `@name` references to named lemmas. No argument → show your peer's twist sequence. Click a peer or lemma name in the sidebar to prefill the input.

Twist alphabet: `^`=Up=0, `v`=Down=1, `>`=Right=2, `<`=Left=3, `/`=Slash=4, `\`=BSlash=5, `+`=Plus=6, `-`=Minus=7. Even values are positive (action); odd are negative (lift).

Input (compose named premises — see `/lemma` below):
```
/qucalc @mortality @socrates
```
Output:
```
· RhoQuCalc process:
·   composed: @mortality @socrates
·   deduction composition:
·     @mortality  →  ^v  (1+/1-)  ZFA: ✓
·     @socrates   →  +-  (1+/1-)  ZFA: ✓
·   composed: ^v+-  (4 total)
·   action (pos): count=2   lift (neg): count=2
·   spectral gap: 0  ZFA-balanced: ✓
·   frequency level: 2  C(4,2) = 6 arrangements
·   process: parallel(action(Form), lift(Form))  → ZFA stable
·   achieves_ZFA: ✓  stable under full_zeno_prune
·   rho_process_always_zfa: ✓ (Lean-verified)
```

Input (unbalanced — invalid argument):
```
/qucalc ^v^v^
```
Output:
```
· RhoQuCalc process:
·   input: ^v^v^
·   twists: ^v^v^  (5 total)
·   action (pos): count=3   lift (neg): count=2
·   spectral gap: 1  ZFA-balanced: ✗
·   process: UNBALANCED  → pruned by full_zeno_prune
·   achieves_ZFA: ✗  gap=1  (not a physical process)
```

ZFA balance is the selection principle: `@major @minor` composed (gap=0) is a valid deduction; an unbalanced composition is pruned by `full_zeno_prune` before becoming a physical event. See [BraKetRhoQuCalc.md](https://github.com/jimscarver/quantum-logical-framework/blob/main/BraKetRhoQuCalc.md) and [QuantumOS.md](https://github.com/jimscarver/quantum-logical-framework/blob/main/QuantumOS.md) for the capability-security model built on this invariant.

### `/grant [label]` [shared]
Mints a fresh ZFA-balanced capability token with the given label, broadcasts it to all peers, and **automatically registers it as `@label` in your local lemma store** so you can immediately `/pass label peer` without any further setup.
```
/grant fork-b
```
Output (you see):
```
granted: cap:fork-b:024602460246024602460246…
  twists: 32  (16 pos, 16 neg)  ZFA-balanced: ✓
  registered as @fork-b — use /pass fork-b <peer> to transfer
```
Output (peers see):
```
· Plato  /grant fork-b
·   cap:fork-b:024602460246024602460246…
·   run /zfa cap:fork-b:… to verify
```

### `/lemma [name [twists]]` [shared]
Names a logical claim so peers can reference it by `@name` in any command. Lemmas sync to all peers when registered and persist to `localStorage` per room URL — they survive page reloads.

- `/lemma` — list all registered lemmas in the room
- `/lemma name` — register `@name` with auto-allocated twists derived deterministically from the name (any peer typing the same command gets the same twists — no server needed)
- `/lemma name twists` — register `@name` with explicit twists (symbolic, `cap:token`, or `@ref1 @ref2`)
- `@name` anywhere in `/qucalc` args — expand and compose named lemmas

When the twist sequence is ZFA-balanced, a `cap:name:hex` capability token is auto-minted and shown. The Lemmas panel in the sidebar lists all names as clickable items — click `@name` to prefill `/qucalc @name`.

Auto-allocate twists from the name (simplest form):
```
/lemma mortality
```
Output:
```
· lemma registered: @mortality  =  <auto>  (auto-allocated)
·   twists: 18  (9+/9-)  ZFA: ✓
·   cap: cap:mortality:…  (share with /zfa to verify)
```

Or supply explicit twists when you want a specific encoding:
```
/lemma mortality ^v
```
Output:
```
· lemma registered: @mortality  =  ^v
·   twists: 2  (1+/1-)  ZFA: ✓
·   cap: cap:mortality:01  (share with /zfa to verify)
```

```
/lemma socrates +-
```
Output:
```
· lemma registered: @socrates  =  +-
·   twists: 2  (1+/1-)  ZFA: ✓
·   cap: cap:socrates:67  (share with /zfa to verify)
```

Chain lemmas to prove the conclusion ("Socrates is Mortal") from the two named premises:
```
/lemma mortal @mortality @socrates
```
Output:
```
· lemma registered: @mortal  =  ^v+-
·   twists: 4  (2+/2-)  ZFA: ✓
·   cap: cap:mortal:0167  (share with /zfa to verify)
```

List the full proof vocabulary:
```
/lemma
```
Output:
```
· lemmas (3):
·   @mortality  =  ^v     [cap: cap:mortality:01]   (by Alice)
·   @socrates   =  +-     [cap: cap:socrates:67]    (by Bob)
·   @mortal     =  ^v+-   [cap: cap:mortal:0167]    (by Alice)
```

### `/request <name>` and `/pass <name> <peer>` [direct]

Transfer a named lemma (and its capability token) directly between peers — no token strings to copy.

- `/request name` — broadcasts that you need `@name`; whoever holds it sees a prompt with the exact `/pass` command to respond
- `/pass name peer-name` — transfers `@name` to the named peer via their data channel; removes it from your lemma store; the recipient auto-registers it

```
Aristotle:  /request fork-b
```
Plato sees:
```
· Aristotle requests @fork-b
· you hold @fork-b — type /pass fork-b Aristotle to transfer
```
Plato types:
```
/pass fork-b aristotle
```
Output on Plato's side:
```
· @fork-b transferred to Aristotle — removed from your lemmas
```
Aristotle's window automatically shows:
```
· @fork-b received from Plato  [cap: cap:fork-b:…]
· run /zfa cap:fork-b:… to verify
```

`/pass` always requires explicit consent — the holder must type the command. `/request` is a broadcast signal, not an automatic transfer. The Dijkstra ordering protocol in [DiningPhilosophersDemo.md](DiningPhilosophersDemo.md) shows these commands in a concurrency context.

### `/note [sub]` [direct]

Promissory notes as ZFA twist sequences. A note is a bearer capability `cap:note-<currency>:<balanced hex>` whose **denomination equals `hex.length / 2`**. Conservation falls out of the existing ZFA balance invariant — split partitions a balanced sequence into two balanced halves, merge concatenates two balanced sequences, and the per-currency denomination total is exactly the sum of positive twists across all held notes of that currency.

Lifecycle modeled on DarkWow's TokenMint → Mint → Transfer → Redeem, implemented over the room's data channel with no ZK, Pedersen, or consensus.

| Subcommand | Effect |
|---|---|
| `/note declare <currency>` | Mints `cap:token-<currency>:…` as your issuer authority and broadcasts the declaration to the room. |
| `/note grant <currency> <N>` | Requires you to hold `cap:token-<currency>`; mints `cap:note-<currency>:hex(2N)` and stores it locally. The denomination-N note never leaves your wallet (no bearer-token broadcast). |
| `/note pass <currency> <N> <peer>` | Finds a held note ≥ N (auto-splits if larger), direct-sends the N-piece to the peer. Atomic: removed from your wallet, registered on the recipient's. |
| `/note redeem <currency> <N> <issuer>` | Direct-sends a note back to the issuer; their handler verifies they hold the matching `cap:token-…`, mints `cap:receipt-<currency>:hex(2N)` back to you, and logs the redemption locally. |
| `/note split <token> <a>` | Partitions a held note into denominations `(a, N−a)`; both halves stay balanced by construction. |
| `/note merge <t1> <t2>` | Concatenates two notes of the same currency. Sum of balanced is balanced. |
| `/note list` / `/note balance [currency]` | Wallet view (also rendered in the sidebar). |

The **Currencies** and **Notes** blocks in the sidebar show held authorities and notes at a glance. Click a currency to prefill `/note grant`; click a note to prefill `/note pass`. Currencies you didn't issue appear with the issuer's label and prefill `/note redeem`.

Example flow (two peers Alice and Bob):

```
Alice:  /note declare USD
        /note grant USD 100
Alice:  /note pass USD 30 Bob
Bob:    /note redeem USD 30 Alice
```

After this sequence: Alice's wallet holds USD 70 (change) and a `redemptionsHonored` log entry; Bob holds `cap:receipt-USD:hex(60)` — a permanent, non-transferable record that Alice honored a USD 30 redemption.

**Conservation**: every operation preserves `count_pos == count_neg` per token. Splitting/merging never changes the total denomination of a wallet. The same Lean invariant that proves `rho_process_always_zfa` covers split (partition of a balanced sequence) and merge (parallel composition of balanced sequences).

**Privacy boundary**: declarations and grant *announcements* broadcast (so the room knows what currencies exist and who issues them). Held notes, receipts, and the issuer's redemption log are private — never sent without an explicit `/note pass` or `/note redeem`.

**Lifecycle vocabulary borrowed from [Patrick Maguire's DarkWow promissory note contract](https://codeberg.org/PatrickM123/darkwow/src/branch/linear-master/doc/src/contract/promissory_note.md)** — DarkWow implements TokenMint → Mint → Transfer → Redeem as a privacy-preserving DeFi contract on a Halo2/Pallas zk-rollup. quantum-os implements the same algebraic shape over a per-room WebRTC data channel, with **conservation enforced by ZFA twist balance** instead of Pedersen commitments — no zk circuits, no global ledger. See [PromissoryNoteDemo.md](PromissoryNoteDemo.md) for the full walkthrough.

### `/rdv [sub]` [direct]

N-party atomic rendezvous: a single composite move across N participants, with ZFA conservation enforced over the joint composition. Each participant contributes a `gives` token and receives a `gets` token; the protocol requires `multiset(gives) == multiset(gets)` — value flows in a closed cycle. The MVP exposes the 2-party bilateral swap (`/rdv swap`); the underlying protocol generalizes to N parties (cyclic).

Protocol (6 direct-send wire kinds, never broadcast):

```
rdv-propose  proposer    → each participant   (carries the proposal)
rdv-accept   participant → proposer           (carries the committed gives token)
rdv-reject   participant → proposer
rdv-counter  either      → either             (round-trip negotiation; new terms + new token)
rdv-commit   proposer    → each participant   (carries final assignments)
rdv-abort    proposer    → each participant   (releases locks)
```

| Subcommand | Effect |
|---|---|
| `/rdv swap <giveCur> <giveN> <getCur> <getN> <peer>` | Locks your gives token, sends a proposal to the peer, sets a 60s timeout. |
| `/rdv counter <id> <giveCur> <giveN> <getCur> <getN>` | Propose new terms in an in-flight rdv. Releases the round's locks; replaces the rows; locks your new gives; counterer is implicitly accepted, other party reset to pending. Either party can counter again; rounds repeat until accept/reject/abort/timeout. |
| `/rdv accept <id>` | Locks your gives token. As a participant, sends accept to the proposer. As proposer-after-counter, locally records acceptance — if all parties now accept, commit fires. |
| `/rdv reject <id>` | Declines; the proposer aborts the proposal and releases all participant locks. |
| `/rdv abort <id>` | Proposer cancels; sends `rdv-abort` to participants. |
| `/rdv list` | Shows pending proposals and currently locked notes. |

**Locking**: while a token is locked for a proposal it moves out of `noteStore` (so `/note pass`, `/note redeem`, etc. don't see it) into a separate `lockedNotes` map. Released back on abort / reject / timeout; consumed on commit (replaced by the gets token).

**Atomicity caveat**: best-effort, same trust model as `/note pass`. If a commit message is lost in flight, the recipient who got it diverges from the one who didn't. True multi-party atomicity needs a consensus layer, which is out of scope.

See [AtomicSwapDemo.md](AtomicSwapDemo.md) for a full Alice/Bob walkthrough — proposal lifecycle, locking, failure modes. The N-of-N multisig discussion lives in its own demo: [MultisigDemo.md](MultisigDemo.md) shows 2-of-2 cosignature using `/dyncap` + `/rdv` (atomic exchange of dyncap-signed attestation tokens). K-of-N threshold multisig needs either a threshold conservation predicate or signature-strength identity beyond what hash-only dyncap provides.

### `/dyncap [sub]`

Hash-only dynamic capabilities. Each peer keeps a private 32-byte `seed` (per-device, persisted to `localStorage` outside the per-room namespace) and publishes `anchor = H(seed)` at name-handshake. Each signable envelope gains a `dyncap` field carrying `{anchor, seq, witness}`, where `witness = H(seed || seq_le32 || room_id_bytes || payload_hash)`.

Uses only `crypto.subtle.digest("SHA-256", …)` — browser built-in, no external library, no keypairs, no signatures.

| Subcommand | Effect |
|---|---|
| `/dyncap status` (or just `/dyncap`) | Show your anchor, current seq, and number of tracked peer chains. |
| `/dyncap peers` | List tracked peers with their TOFU-pinned anchors and last-seen seq; flags `⚠ CONTESTED` if a fork was observed. |

Outbound signing is wired into the highest-value envelopes: `name` (TOFU bootstrap on each new data channel), `lemma`, `note-declare`, and the `sync-lemmas` / `sync-currencies` envelopes (whose entries forward their original signer's dyncap).

Trust ceiling: this is **TOFU plus chain-tamper / replay / fork detection**, not signature-strength identity. Receivers cannot mathematically verify a witness was correctly derived from `seed` — they treat it as opaque-unique per `(anchor, seq)`. Two valid envelopes at the same `seq` under the same anchor are a fork: the peer's identity is flagged contested and the user is warned. The deliberate trade is that the QLF algebra remains the security model; identity is extended via continuity rather than borrowing a separate asymmetric primitive.

See [MultisigDemo.md](MultisigDemo.md) for a worked example combining `/dyncap` with `/rdv`.

### `/probe [sub]`

Joiner-local consensus probe — partial Byzantine-leaning resolution layered on top of the existing room-state sync. On `onSignalingOpen`, opens a probe window for `PROBE_WINDOW_MS` (5 s) that collects inbound `sync-lemmas` / `sync-currencies` envelopes from up to `SAMPLE_SIZE` (5) distinct peers. On close, for each contested key, the probe tallies a chain-weighted vote: each peer's vote weight is their dyncap `lastSeq` (floor 1), and the winning value must clear a strict `SUPERMAJORITY_NUM / SUPERMAJORITY_DEN` (2/3) of the total weight. Below threshold, `winner === null` and the key remains contested but is broadcast for the room's benefit; the joiner keeps their own local value. Above threshold, the joiner adopts the winner and adds the peers behind every losing bucket to `ignoredForSync` — their subsequent sync envelopes are silently dropped.

| Subcommand | Effect |
|---|---|
| `/probe status` (or just `/probe`) | Show the probe window state and the per-room ignored-for-sync peer list. |
| `/probe clear` | Clear the ignored-for-sync set (e.g., after manual reconciliation). |

This is **not** classical BFT — there's no global agreement, no finality, no resolution that binds non-joining peers. Each new joiner reaches their own decision independently. The probe raises the attacker cost (sync forgery now needs supermajority weight, not first-arrival) but doesn't prove tolerance against coordinated, aged-identity Sybils. See [Consensus.md](Consensus.md) for the full protocol specification, threat analysis, and comparison with classical BFT.

Lemmas are now content-addressed by name: `/lemma X ^v` refuses to re-declare `@X` with different twists, both locally and on inbound broadcast. The probe relies on this so that disagreement reflects genuine partition (or forgery) rather than accidental overwrite.

Example flow (Alice has USD 100, Bob has EUR 100):

```
Alice:  /rdv swap USD 30 EUR 20 Bob
        → · proposed rendezvous a3f1c2…  expires in 60s
Bob:    /rdv accept a3f1c2
        → · accepted rendezvous a3f1c2 — locked EUR 20; awaiting commit…
Alice:  → · committed rdv a3f1c2
Bob:    → · rdv a3f1c2 settled
```

After settlement: Alice holds USD 70 + EUR 20, Bob holds EUR 80 + USD 30. Both wallets total identical-denominated value to before; only the assignment changed.

**Sync on join**: when a new peer joins, every existing peer sends them a snapshot of `lemmaStore` and the room's currency registry (`knownCurrencies`) over each new data channel. Late joiners see currencies declared before they arrived; they do *not* see held notes, receipts, or in-flight rendezvous proposals — only room-knowledge stores are gossiped.

### `/id`
Shows your ZFA-balanced peer identity and confirms the `rho_process_always_zfa` invariant holds.
```
peer ID: cap:peer:024602460246024602460246…
  twists: 32  (16 positive, 16 negative)
  ZFA-balanced: ✓  spectral gap: 0
  rho_process_always_zfa: ✓ (Lean-verified)
```
Lean anchor: [`rho_process_always_zfa`](https://github.com/jimscarver/quantum-logical-framework/blob/main/lean/RhoQuCalc.lean)

### `/room [sub]`

Multi-room tabs. A single browser session can be joined to N rooms simultaneously, each in its own tab across the top of the UI. Each room is a separate Markov blanket — independent peers, lemma store, currency registry, notes, dyncap chain, consensus probe, and signaling connection. The room you're looking at is the *uiActive* room; background tabs continue to receive and process their own envelopes, with state mutations correctly routed via per-callback context capture (no cross-talk between rooms). Activity in a background tab surfaces as an orange `●` indicator on its tab.

| Subcommand | Effect |
|---|---|
| `/room` or `/room list` | Show the active room's cap-token + twist stats, plus a list of joined rooms with their connection (`●`) and active (`←`) markers. |
| `/room join <cap:room:…\|url>` | Open a new tab joined to the named room. Accepts a raw cap-token or a share URL. The new tab is created but does not auto-connect — click Connect to bring up signaling. |
| `/room leave` | Close the active tab. The room's state stays in `localStorage` so re-joining picks up where you left off; the connection is dropped. Can't close the last remaining tab. |
| `/room ref [cap:room:…]` | Print a shareable URL for the active room (or the given cap). |

Joined rooms persist across reloads (`qos-joined-rooms` in `localStorage`); on next launch the same tabs are restored, with the URL-hash room re-activated. The `+` button on the tab bar prompts for a room cap or URL.

**Markov-blanket constraints** (deliberate):
- No cross-room signaling backchannel — each room has its own `QOSPeer` and signaling WebSocket.
- No cross-room state sync — a lemma declared in one room doesn't auto-propagate to others.
- No cross-room consensus — the probe runs per-room.
- Cross-room information flow is mediated by a peer who's in both rooms (a "bridge peer"); they consciously re-broadcast in each room. There's no automatic `/share` command yet — manual re-declaration is the bridge primitive today.

A peer in N rooms has the same dyncap *anchor* across rooms (it's `H(seed)` where seed is per-device), but each room maintains an independent chain trajectory via per-room `seq` in `DynCapState.seqByRoom`. The witness binding `H(seed ‖ seq ‖ room_id ‖ payload_hash)` produces algebraically independent witnesses across rooms.

### `/share <selector> to <room-prefix>`

Bridge selected state from the active tab into another joined tab. The bridge is application-level: `/share` briefly swaps the active room context to the target room and runs the existing dispatcher commands there. The target room sees the action as if the user typed it locally — including the bridge peer's dyncap signature in *that* room's chain. No new wire kinds; no infrastructure relay.

| Selector | Effect in target |
|---|---|
| `@<lemma-name>` | re-declare the lemma. Lemma immutability applies (same twists → silent no-op; different twists → refused) |
| `msg <text>` | post a chat message |
| `note <currency> <N>` | `/note grant <currency> <N>` (target room must hold the currency authority) |

Target resolution: `<room-prefix>` prefix-matches against joined room IDs. Ambiguous matches are listed; no match errors out.

### `/channel [sub]`

Name-tagged broadcast messaging with per-receiver filtering. The envelope (`kind: "channel-msg", {channel, payload}`) goes to everyone in the room; subscribed peers surface it in chat, unsubscribed peers silently drop it. Subscriptions are per-room and persist across reloads (`qos-channel-subs-{room}` in localStorage).

| Subcommand | Effect |
|---|---|
| `/channel list` (or `/channel`) | Show your subscriptions in the active room |
| `/channel listen <name>` | Subscribe |
| `/channel unlisten <name>` | Unsubscribe |
| `/channel send <name> <text>` | Broadcast a tagged message |

Useful for topic-based coordination on top of broadcast — e.g., one channel per long-running discussion, or as the substrate for higher-level macro languages (rho-calculus channels).

### `/script <cmd1>; <cmd2>; …`

Sequential command chain. Each `;`-separated segment is trimmed and run through the dispatcher exactly as if typed individually. Segments starting with `//` are skipped (comments). Errors in one segment don't stop subsequent ones; each segment's output appears in chat in order.

```
/script /grant fork-a; /lemma alice-thinking; /qucalc @alice-thinking
/script /note declare USD; /note grant USD 100; // /note pass USD 30 Bob
```

The MVP is single-line. Multi-line scripts and variable binding are deferred.

### `/persist [sub]`

Agreed cross-peer replication of public room state. A peer asks another to also store a lemma or currency declaration; the receiver explicitly accepts or rejects. Both peers then hold redundant copies across sessions. The existing consensus probe + chain-weighted supermajority resolution reconciles any drift on the next join.

| Subcommand | Effect |
|---|---|
| `/persist @<lemma> to <peer>` | Ask peer to also store the lemma |
| `/persist currency <name> to <peer>` | Ask peer to also store the currency declaration |
| `/persist accept <id>` | Accept a pending inbound request |
| `/persist reject <id>` | Discard a pending inbound request |
| `/persist [list]` | Show pending inbound requests |

Bearer state (held notes, receipts, redemption logs) is excluded by design — replicating a bearer token means giving away ownership, which is what `/note pass` already does. `/persist` applies only to public room knowledge.

The "persistence" is "as long as one of the replicating peers is online" — there's no server, no eternal storage. Multiple agreeing copies are the agreement-based mechanism.

### `/rhoqu <text>`

RhoQu macro language — a thin syntactic surface that compiles to the shipped slash commands. The body is parsed by `packages/browser/src/rhoqu.ts` into an AST and transpiled to a `string[]` of `/commands`, each dispatched in order through the regular handler.

| Construct | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `process name(args…) { body }` | Define a parameterized macro. Calls inline at call site with substituted `$arg`s. |
| `name(…); name(…);` | Sequential calls (or any sequence of `/commands` separated by `;`). |
| `s1 \| s2 \| s3` | Parallel composition — each statement is grouped as a parallel block; on a single peer the group still executes sequentially, but the `\|` records "no ordering dependency." |
| `if cond { … } else { … }` | Transpile-time branch. Conditions evaluate against current room state: `bal(@name)`, `peers`, `connected`, `seq`, `hasLemma(@name)`, plus `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `and`, `or`, `not`. |
| `on channel(payload) { body }` | Register a `/channel` dispatcher: when an inbound `channel-msg` on `channel` arrives, bind `payload` to its text and execute `body`. Survives across messages until `/rhoqu clear`. |
| `new name in { body }` | Mint a fresh `cap` named `name`, bind for the lexical body, broadcast as a lemma. |
| `for x in [a, b, c]: stmt;` | Unroll a list at transpile time. |
| `$var` | Substitute a process-parameter or `for`-bound value. |

Sub-commands:

| Subcommand | Effect |
|---|---|
| `/rhoqu <text>` | Parse, transpile, and dispatch the body. |
| `/rhoqu list` | List registered `on` handlers in the active room. |
| `/rhoqu clear` | Drop all registered handlers. |

Example (parallel grant + immediate dispatch):
```
/rhoqu process setup(label, p1, p2) { /grant $label; /pass $label $p1 | /pass $label $p2; } setup(fork-a, Alice, Bob);
```

Example (transpile-time guard):
```
/rhoqu if bal(@attest-alice) >= 1 and bal(@attest-bob) == 0 { /rdv swap attest-alice 1 attest-bob 1 Bob; }
```

Example (on handler):
```
/rhoqu /channel listen orders; on orders(text) { /qucalc $text; }
```

See [RhoQuDemo.md](RhoQuDemo.md) for worked end-to-end demos (atomic swap with conditional accept, Dining Philosophers, multisig with persistence).

### `/zfa [token]`
Validates any `cap:label:hex` token — checks ZFA balance and reports the spectral gap.
```
/zfa cap:room:024602460246024602460246…
  valid: ✓  spectral gap: 0
  twists: 32 (16 positive, 16 negative)
```
Lean anchor: [`achieves_ZFA`](https://github.com/jimscarver/quantum-logical-framework/blob/main/lean/QLF_Axioms.lean)

### `/cap [label]`
Generates a fresh ZFA-balanced capability token locally (not shared).
```
generated: cap:peer:024602460246024602460246…
  twists: 32  (16 pos, 16 neg)  ZFA-balanced: ✓
```
Rust source: [`crates/zfa-core/src/capability.rs`](crates/zfa-core/src/capability.rs)

### `//message`
Sends a literal message that starts with `/` (escapes the command prefix).

## Architecture

```
crates/
  zfa-core/          Rust — ZFA kernel
                     → compiles to WASM (browser) and native binary (server)

packages/
  zfa-core-wasm/     wasm-pack output (build artifact, not committed)
  signaling/         TypeScript — WebSocket signaling server (port 4444)
  browser/           TypeScript — WebRTC peer, loads ZFA WASM
```

**Monorepo:** Cargo workspace + pnpm workspace.

---

## ZFA Security Model

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the full threat model, known issues, and vulnerability reporting policy.

The 8-twist alphabet `{^, v, <, >, /, \, +, -}` encodes all processes. A history achieves **ZFA** when both algebraic conditions hold (enforced uniformly in Rust, WASM, TypeScript, and the QLF Python core since v0.17):

1. **Count balance** — `count_pos = count_neg` (spectral gap = 0).
2. **Pauli closure** — the matrix product of twists folds to a scalar multiple of identity (`{+I, −I, +iI, −iI}`). Each twist maps to a Pauli matrix (`^v` ↔ ±σ_y, `<>` ↔ ∓σ_x, `/\` ↔ ±σ_z, `+-` ↔ ±I); order matters because Pauli matrices anti-commute.

`Capability::from_entropy` uses rejection sampling so every issued token satisfies both conditions by construction — unbalanced or Pauli-open tokens are algebraically impossible to construct, not merely rejected at runtime.

Key invariants (machine-verified in [QLF](https://github.com/jimscarver/quantum-logical-framework)):
- `achieves_zfa` — the conjunction of count balance and Pauli closure
- `spectral_gap = 0 ↔ is_symmetric` — eigenvalue-level stability
- `decoherence_impossibility` — parallel composition stays ZFA-balanced
- `no_magnetic_monopoles` — Gauss law from ZFA (∇·B = 0)

---

## Quick Start

```bash
bash scripts/setup.sh   # installs Rust, wasm-pack, Node, pnpm; builds everything
```

Then in two terminals:

```bash
pnpm dev:signaling      # WebSocket signaling server on ws://localhost:4444
pnpm dev:browser        # browser dev server (Vite)
```

### Manual setup

```bash
# 1. Rust + wasm-pack
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
cargo install wasm-pack
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

# 2. Node + pnpm
# install Node 20+ via nvm or your package manager
npm install -g pnpm

# 3. Build WASM kernel (must run before pnpm install)
pnpm build:wasm

# 4. JS dependencies
pnpm install

# 5. Build signaling server
pnpm build:signaling
```

## Build commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `pnpm test:rust` | Run all Rust unit tests |
| `pnpm build:wasm` | Build `crates/zfa-core` → WASM via wasm-pack |
| `pnpm build:signaling` | Compile signaling server TypeScript |
| `pnpm dev:signaling` | Start signaling server (ws://localhost:4444) |
| `pnpm dev:browser` | Vite dev server for browser peer |

---

## Using the Browser Peer

```typescript
import { loadZfa, generateCapability, QOSPeer } from "@quantum-os/browser";

// Load ZFA WASM kernel
await loadZfa();

// Every room is identified by a ZFA capability token
const roomId = generateCapability("room");

const peer = new QOSPeer({
  signalingUrl: "ws://localhost:4444",
  roomId,
  onMessage: (from, data) => console.log(`[${from}]`, data),
  onPeerJoined: (id) => console.log("peer joined:", id),
  onPeerLeft:   (id) => console.log("peer left:",   id),
});

await peer.connect();

// Send to a specific peer or broadcast
peer.send(targetPeerId, { type: "hello" });
peer.broadcast({ type: "ping" });
```

---

## Rust ZFA Core

```rust
use zfa_core::{achieves_zfa, spectral_gap, Capability};
use zfa_core::twist::Twist;

let h = vec![Twist::Up, Twist::Down, Twist::Plus, Twist::Minus];
assert!(achieves_zfa(&h));
assert_eq!(spectral_gap(&h), 0);

// Unforgeable ZFA-balanced capability token
let cap = Capability::root("kernel");
assert!(cap.is_valid());
assert_eq!(cap.spectral_gap(), 0);
```

---

## Signaling Protocol

The signaling server is a thin WebSocket relay — it never sees data channel contents. Messages:

| Direction | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| client → server | `join` | Enter a room with a peer ID |
| server → client | `peers` | List of existing peers in the room |
| server → others | `joined` | Notify existing peers of new arrival |
| client → server | `offer` / `answer` / `ice` | WebRTC handshake relay |
| client → server | `leave` | Exit the room |
| server → others | `left` | Notify peers of departure |

Room IDs are ZFA capability tokens — knowing the room ID is the capability to join.

### Connection reliability

The signaling layer is designed to survive network interruptions without losing the room:

- **Server heartbeat** — the server pings every client every 25 seconds. Browsers respond automatically at the protocol level; connections that miss two consecutive pings are terminated cleanly. This keeps Fly.io's proxy from silently closing idle WebSocket connections.
- **Auto-reconnect** — if the signaling WebSocket drops, the client reconnects after 3 seconds (5 seconds on repeated failure) and re-joins the room. Existing peers detect the rejoin via the `joined` message and re-establish data channels via the normal offer/answer flow.
- **ICE failure detection** — `RTCPeerConnection.onconnectionstatechange` is monitored; a `"failed"` state triggers cleanup and notifies the app, so the peer list stays accurate rather than showing stale connected peers.
- **Free-tier server — hosted on Render (free tier); first connection after 15 min idle may take ~30s to wake. The heartbeat and auto-reconnect logic handles this transparently.

---

## Rust + WASM Integration

The same `crates/zfa-core` crate compiles to:
- **WASM** (`--target web` via wasm-pack) — loaded by the browser peer
- **Native** (`cargo build`) — for server-side peers and CLI tools

WASM exports (via `wasm-bindgen`, enabled with `--features wasm`):

```typescript
wasm_achieves_zfa(twists: Uint8Array): boolean
wasm_is_pauli_closed(twists: Uint8Array): boolean
wasm_spectral_gap(twists: Uint8Array): number
wasm_div_b(twists: Uint8Array): number
wasm_charge(twists: Uint8Array): number
wasm_capability_from_entropy(bytes: Uint8Array, label: string): string
wasm_capability_valid(hex: string): boolean
```
