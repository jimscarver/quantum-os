# quantum-os

Peer-to-peer QuantumOS running in the browser. ZFA kernel in Rust/WASM, WebRTC data channels for transport, self-hosted signaling server.

**Foundation:** [Quantum Logical Framework](https://github.com/jimscarver/quantum-logical-framework) — ZFA (Zero Free Action) is the security model. Every peer identity is a ZFA-balanced capability token. Possessing a token IS authorization (Curry-Howard for capabilities).

## Architecture

```
crates/
  zfa-core/          Rust — ZFA kernel
                     → compiles to WASM (browser) and native binary (server)

packages/
  zfa-core-wasm/     wasm-pack output (build artifact, not committed)
  signaling/         TypeScript — WebSocket signaling server (port 4444)
  browser/           TypeScript — WebRTC peer, loads ZFA WASM
```

**Monorepo:** Cargo workspace + pnpm workspace.

## ZFA Security Model

The 8-twist alphabet `{^, v, <, >, /, \, +, -}` encodes all processes. A history is **ZFA-balanced** when `count_pos = count_neg` (spectral gap = 0). Every capability token, peer identity, and room ID is ZFA-balanced by construction — unbalanced tokens are algebraically impossible to construct, not merely rejected at runtime.

Key invariants (machine-verified in [QLF](https://github.com/jimscarver/quantum-logical-framework)):
- `achieves_zfa` — the physical ZFA condition
- `spectral_gap = 0 ↔ is_symmetric` — eigenvalue-level stability
- `decoherence_impossibility` — parallel composition stays ZFA-balanced
- `no_magnetic_monopoles` — Gauss law from ZFA (∇·B = 0)

---

## Quick Start

```bash
bash scripts/setup.sh   # installs Rust, wasm-pack, Node, pnpm; builds everything
```

Then in two terminals:

```bash
pnpm dev:signaling      # WebSocket signaling server on ws://localhost:4444
pnpm dev:browser        # browser dev server (Vite)
```

### Manual setup

```bash
# 1. Rust + wasm-pack
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
cargo install wasm-pack
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

# 2. Node + pnpm
# install Node 20+ via nvm or your package manager
npm install -g pnpm

# 3. Build WASM kernel (must run before pnpm install)
pnpm build:wasm

# 4. JS dependencies
pnpm install

# 5. Build signaling server
pnpm build:signaling
```

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `pnpm test:rust` | Run all Rust unit tests |
| `pnpm build:wasm` | Build `crates/zfa-core` → WASM via wasm-pack |
| `pnpm build:signaling` | Compile signaling server TypeScript |
| `pnpm dev:signaling` | Start signaling server (ws://localhost:4444) |
| `pnpm dev:browser` | Vite dev server for browser peer |
| `pnpm build` | Full build: WASM + signaling + browser |

---

## Using the Browser Peer

```typescript
import { loadZfa, generateCapability, QOSPeer } from "@quantum-os/browser";

// Load ZFA WASM kernel
await loadZfa();

// Every room is identified by a ZFA capability token
const roomId = generateCapability("room");

const peer = new QOSPeer({
  signalingUrl: "ws://localhost:4444",
  roomId,
  onMessage: (from, data) => console.log(`[${from}]`, data),
  onPeerJoined: (id) => console.log("peer joined:", id),
  onPeerLeft:   (id) => console.log("peer left:",   id),
});

await peer.connect();

// Send to a specific peer or broadcast
peer.send(targetPeerId, { type: "hello" });
peer.broadcast({ type: "ping" });
```

---

## Rust ZFA Core

```rust
use zfa_core::{achieves_zfa, spectral_gap, Capability};
use zfa_core::twist::Twist;

let h = vec![Twist::Up, Twist::Down, Twist::Plus, Twist::Minus];
assert!(achieves_zfa(&h));
assert_eq!(spectral_gap(&h), 0);

// Unforgeable ZFA-balanced capability token
let cap = Capability::root("kernel");
assert!(cap.is_valid());
assert_eq!(cap.spectral_gap(), 0);
```

---

## Signaling Protocol

The signaling server is a thin WebSocket relay — it never sees data channel contents. Messages:

| Direction | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| client → server | `join` | Enter a room with a peer ID |
| server → client | `peers` | List of existing peers in the room |
| server → others | `joined` | Notify existing peers of new arrival |
| client → server | `offer` / `answer` / `ice` | WebRTC handshake relay |
| client → server | `leave` | Exit the room |
| server → others | `left` | Notify peers of departure |

Room IDs are ZFA capability tokens — knowing the room ID is the capability to join.

---

## Rust + WASM Integration

The same `crates/zfa-core` crate compiles to:
- **WASM** (`--target web` via wasm-pack) — loaded by the browser peer
- **Native** (`cargo build`) — for server-side peers and CLI tools

WASM exports (via `wasm-bindgen`, enabled with `--features wasm`):

```typescript
wasm_achieves_zfa(twists: Uint8Array): boolean
wasm_spectral_gap(twists: Uint8Array): number
wasm_div_b(twists: Uint8Array): number
wasm_charge(twists: Uint8Array): number
wasm_capability_from_entropy(bytes: Uint8Array, label: string): string
wasm_capability_valid(hex: string): boolean
```

## Status

| Component | Status |
|---|---|
| ZFA Rust kernel | ✓ 18/18 tests pass |
| WASM build | ✓ wasm-pack, wasm-bindgen |
| Signaling server | ✓ running, ws://0.0.0.0:4444 |
| Browser TypeScript | ✓ 0 type errors |
| WebRTC peer | Scaffold (needs browser to test data channels) |
| Native Rust peer | Planned |
