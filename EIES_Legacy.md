# The EIES legacy

QuantumOS is the third EIES. The first two were built at NJIT's Computerized
Conferencing and Communications Center, and much of what this repository is
trying to do was tried there first — some of it successfully enough that the
right move now is to copy it rather than reinvent it.

This document records that lineage: what EIES did, which parts this project is
descended from, and which lessons are load-bearing in the current design. It is
written down because the reasoning behind several decisions here is only legible
if you know they were decided once already.

## The systems

**EIES (1976–)** — computer-mediated conferencing, built under Murray Turoff at
NJIT with NSF funding, from work begun in 1974. Electronic mail, conferences,
membership directories, data collection forms, global searches, personal
indexing. It ran for years and carried real communities: scientific research
groups, the homebound handicapped, and eventually classrooms.

**EIES2 (1980s–90s)** — directed by Jim Whitescarver, implementing distributed
Smalltalk as a research, development and operational environment for distributed
CSCW. It supported the Virtual Classroom for years, until funding to maintain it
ran out. That thread continues here — see the
[Collaborative Learning case study](CollaborativeLearningCaseStudy.md) and
[Room Best Practices](Room_Best_Practices.md).

**QuantumOS** — this repository. Peer-to-peer [rooms](MyRoom.md), a ZFA kernel,
[governance by liquid democracy](Governance.md), and a
[bridge to a chain](Room_Bridges.md) for the things that must outlive the room.
The vision it serves is stated in the [Manifesto](Manifesto.md); the
[README](README.md) is the practical entry point and the
[User Guide](User_Guide.md) is where to start using it.

## INTERACT: user programming, and why it matters here

The part of EIES most directly ancestral to this project is INTERACT, its
command language. Jim Whitescarver was largely responsible for it, along with
John Howell, Dave Harvy and Al Leurck. He and Turoff published on an early
version as an interface language around 1979.

INTERACT was BASIC-like — real control flow, powerful array functions,
dictionaries — and was both an interface language and a general-purpose one.
Commands were inputs to the system that could read prompts and answer them
conditionally, matching on the text of the last input to decide what to do next.
Many commands never touched the system at all and were simply programs.

Most commands were written by users, or by group effort — tailoring a group's
communication structures, defining its roles, or simply adding utility. What
happened next is the interesting part, and it is the thing this project wants to
reproduce:

> People wrote hundreds of commands, shared them with others, and groups adopted
> them. The most useful were made global system commands. It was user
> programming at its finest, and collaborative system development at its finest.

The mechanism was ordinary. **A `+command` was one line** — an input to the
system, the same as anything else a user typed. It did not necessarily involve a
file. Often that one line was another `+command`, which did a `+get` of a file,
rather than answering the prompt directly; the file was indirection a command
could reach for, not the thing a command was.

`+define` made a command. `+addgroupcommand` put one in a group's hands, by a
moderator role. `+addsyscommand` required write permission to the system command
directory — held by superusers, who were often the students who had broken the
security and then fixed it.

So the personal → group → global hierarchy was **ownership and directory
permissions**, with a human decision at each boundary. Not a governance system.
The social process — sharing, adopting, promoting what proved useful — happened
around the mechanism rather than inside it.

### `+mypriv`, the enabling primitive

The most powerful command was `+mypriv`. Where a command was backed by a file,
its owner could use `+mypriv` to do anything they were allowed to do as
themselves — **suid, in Unix terms — and that is what enabled groupware**.

This is worth stating plainly because it is easy to miss: without it, a shared
command can only do what its *caller* could already do, which is to say nothing
worth sharing. The command has to be able to act with the authority of the person
who wrote it. That single property is what turns a personal script into something
another person can usefully run, and it is why hundreds of commands were worth
writing and sharing.

**A capability is `+mypriv` with the ambient authority removed.** Rather than "run
as the owner, with everything the owner can do", a macro carries the specific
capabilities its author chose to place in it. Same enabling property; a much
narrower blast radius; and no superuser needed to administer the boundary,
because holding the cap *is* the permission.

That is why [the macro design](https://github.com/rchain-community/quantum-os/issues/65)
starts with capabilities and defers governance. It is not a simplification of the
EIES model — it is the EIES model with the suid bit sharpened into an object.

## What carries over

**User programming is the point, not a feature.** EIES's command library was
written by its users, not its authors. A system where only the maintainers can
extend the vocabulary gets the vocabulary its maintainers imagined. The current
library is [RChain_Macros.md](RChain_Macros.md) — deprecated, and being
redesigned in [#65](https://github.com/rchain-community/quantum-os/issues/65)
around exactly this; [RhoQuCalc_Macros.md](RhoQuCalc_Macros.md) is the qucalc
side of it.

**Adoption should be social, mechanism should be boring.** Permissions and
ownership were enough. What made a command spread was that it was useful and
someone shared it. Elaborate promotion machinery was not required and is still
not required — [`/gov`](Governance.md) exists here for groups that eventually
want more, and should stay optional. How groups actually decide is
[Group_Decisions.md](Group_Decisions.md), with a worked example in the
[Governance case study](GovernanceCaseStudy.md).

**The enabling primitive is authority, not syntax.** `+mypriv` mattered more than
anything about INTERACT's grammar. When designing here, the question "what
authority does this carry, and whose?" is the one that decides whether something
is shareable. What this project can and cannot enforce about that is
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

**Curation emerges.** "The most useful were made global system commands" was a
judgment someone made, repeatedly, over time. Worth designing for a curator role
existing rather than pretending ranking will be automatic — the roles a room
already recognises are in [Room_Best_Practices.md](Room_Best_Practices.md), and
the [Specialist Room case study](SpecialistRoomCaseStudy.md) is one worked
through.

## What is deliberately different

**Not an interface language.** INTERACT commands answered prompts by matching on
their text. That couples a command to the exact wording of an interface and
breaks when the wording changes. The aim here is the same effect reached *more
formally*: rholang processes coordinate over named channels, so a macro binds to
a channel rather than scraping output. Matching on prompt text is what you do
when there is no channel to bind to; here there is one. `/rholang` is how a room
reaches a chain at all — see [Room_Bridges.md](Room_Bridges.md) and the
[Developer Guide](Developer_Guide.md).

**No superusers.** EIES's system command directory was gated by people with root.
Here the equivalent boundary is holding a capability, which is delegable,
auditable, and does not require anyone to be trusted with everything. The
threat model and what is actually enforced are in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

**Peer-to-peer, and durable by choice.** EIES was a host everyone dialled into.
A QuantumOS room is peer-to-peer and ephemeral by default; what needs to outlive
the room is deployed to a chain deliberately. The persistence that EIES got for
free from being a mainframe has to be asked for here — which is a cost, and also
means no one operator can end the conversation.

**Where it is going.** The macro language is meant to grow into interactive
rholang process orchestration. Template expansion is the seed, not the
destination.
